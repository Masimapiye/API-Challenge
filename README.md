### Weather Data Observed trends
#### The temperature increases as you approach a lattitude of zero on both sides of the hemisphere.
#### There is a strong negative correlation between temperature and lattitude in the northen hemisphere where the temperature decreases with increasing lattitude.
#### This is the opposite for the Southern Hemisphere where the temperature generally icreases with increasing lattitude.
#### This is explained by the fact that countries with lattitudes closer to the equator generally receive the most sun and hence are warmer.
#### The data does not show any strong trends between humidity and lattitude across both hemispheres.
#### Wind speed is generally not affected by lattitude as the data does not show any strong trends.
