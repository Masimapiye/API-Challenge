#### There is a strong negative correlation between temperature and lattitude in the northen hemisphere where the temperature decreases with increasing lattitude.
#### This is the opposite for the Southern Hemisphere where the temperature generally icreases with increasing lattitude.
#### The data does not show any strong trends between humidity and lattitude across both hemispheres
#### Wind speed is generally not affected by lattitude as the data does not show any strong trends.
